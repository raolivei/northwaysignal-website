Here’s a single, high-impact creative prompt you can drop into a web designer, AI site builder, or creative agent (Framer, Webflow, Midjourney → design handoff, etc.).

Creative Prompt — “Pitanga” Website

Design a premium, founder-led consulting website called “Pitanga.”

Pitanga is a modern consulting studio built by a senior cloud systems engineer. Today, it delivers high-trust consulting services for SurveyMonkey, but it is intentionally designed to scale into cloud architecture, platform engineering, and applied AI advisory over time.

Brand Feel
	•	Calm, confident, minimalist
	•	Founder-driven credibility (not agency fluff)
	•	Feels like “quietly elite” engineering
	•	Inspired by Stripe, Vercel, Linear, OpenAI (clarity over noise)
	•	Premium but human — thoughtful, warm, precise

Visual Language
	•	Clean typography, generous whitespace
	•	Muted natural palette (deep green, charcoal, off-white) with subtle accent color inspired by the pitanga fruit
	•	Light motion, micro-interactions, no heavy animations
	•	Abstract system visuals: networks, flows, architecture lines (not stock photos of people)

Site Structure
	1.	Hero
	•	One-sentence positioning:
“High-leverage cloud and platform consulting, built for scale.”
	•	Subtext hinting at evolution into AI & advanced systems
	2.	What Pitanga Is
	•	A focused consulting entity today
	•	A long-term platform for cloud, infra, and AI expertise
	3.	Services (Now & Future-Ready)
	•	Platform & Cloud Architecture
	•	Reliability & Systems Design
	•	Strategic Technical Advisory
	•	Future-facing: AI systems, automation, decision intelligence
	4.	Approach
	•	Pragmatic
	•	Outcome-driven
	•	Low-ceremony, high-impact
	•	Built by someone who has run systems in production
	5.	Founder Section
	•	Personal, credible, understated
	•	Emphasize experience, judgment, and trust
	•	Avoid buzzwords; focus on signal
	6.	Call to Action
	•	Simple and discreet:
“Start a conversation.”

Tone of Voice
	•	Confident, not loud
	•	Precise, not verbose
	•	Visionary, but grounded
	•	No marketing jargon

Important Constraint

The site must feel complete and credible today, while clearly leaving room for Pitanga to evolve into a broader cloud & AI studio without needing a redesign.

The end result should feel like:
“This company is small by choice — not by limitation.”
